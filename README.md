Mining Station
Mining Station is mining algorithm autoswitching solution based on popular online service whattomine.com. All you need to do is to tell it what coins are to be mined by a rig, what are their hashrates, energy consumption etc. Then you will be able to calculate profit individually for each rig, check which machines are online, what are the coins they mine and switch coins manually as well as automatically on multiple machines at once. 

The application is free and open source. You don't have to edit config files meticulously, instead you can tune almost everything via neat and practical GUI. 

Mining Station is not for greedy people but for lazy ones. Autoswitch doesnâ€™t necessarily have profitability advantage, it simply makes life easier. Mining Station has a built-in back testing capability, you can accumulate daily price data and later see a chart that shows how the autoswitch performed compared to mining any single coin. The autoswitch averages on long enough periods and because of its random nature - one day it guesses the most profitable coin correctly, the other day it gives false detection and the rig mines below the maximum potential profit for some time - the autoswitch's profit might be even lower than mining a single coin at times.

Mining Station is portable application. To install it simply copy the Mining Station.exe file to the folder of your choice. When migrating to a different machine simple copy this folder. Workers.cfg contains the rig configuration templates and WtmSettings.cfg contains app's settings.
